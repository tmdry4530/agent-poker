# MVP1 CHECKLIST (Definition of Done)

## Must-have
- [ ] 2 agents can play 20 hands end-to-end locally
- [ ] Deterministic replay reproduces the same final hand outcome from event log
- [ ] Invalid actions are rejected with structured error codes
- [ ] Timeouts handled deterministically
- [ ] Virtual chips ledger is correct (double-entry; idempotent refs)
- [ ] docs/STATUS.md, docs/WORKLOG.md, docs/FAILURE_LOG.md maintained

## Nice-to-have
- [ ] Matchmaking
- [ ] Observability metrics
- [ ] ACPC compatibility adapter
