description: Update docs/STATUS.md + docs/WORKLOG.md + docs/FAILURE_LOG.md like a real dev team after changes.
---

Rules:
- Always update docs/STATUS.md to reflect current state.
- Append entries to docs/WORKLOG.md (timestamped).
- If anything failed, add an item to docs/FAILURE_LOG.md with repro + prevention test.
- Keep entries concise but actionable.
