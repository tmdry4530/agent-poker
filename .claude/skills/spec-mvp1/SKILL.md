description: Update MVP1 spec (PRD + acceptance criteria + open questions) without adding Web3 scope.
---

Read docs/PRD_MVP1.md and improve it:
- Clarify rules (game type, betting structure, timeouts).
- Define explicit acceptance criteria (measurable).
- List open questions and propose default decisions.

Constraints:
- MVP1 is virtual chips only.
- Minimal human UI.
